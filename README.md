# self-sovereign-identity

In her bachelor thesis Veronika Sedlackova investigated the extent to which users can regain more control over their identity data in the digital world. For this purpose, a concept was presented that replaces classic centralized authentication procedures with decentralized ones and digitizes physical proofs of identity such as an ID card. Based on this, it was examined whether this concept complies with data protection requirements. This work was illustrated by a prototype that simulates the exchange of a digital proof of identity.
